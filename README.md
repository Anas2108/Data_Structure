# Data Structure Implementations

This repository contains C++ implementations of two common data structures: vectors and linked lists.

# Vector
A vector is a dynamic array that can resize itself as needed to accommodate new elements. 
It supports efficient random access and constant time insertion and deletion at the end of the vector.

# Linked List
A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing a reference to the next node in the list. 
It supports constant time insertion and deletion at the beginning and end of the list, as well as efficient traversal of the list.
# Double Linked List
A doubly linked list is a type of data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each of which contains two pointers, one pointing to the previous node and one pointing to the next node. In addition to the traditional "next" pointer found in a singly linked list, a doubly linked list also has a "previous" pointer that allows traversal of the list in both directions.
The advantage of a doubly linked list over a singly linked list is that it allows for more efficient traversal of the list in both directions. However, it also requires more memory to store the additional pointer, and the extra complexity can make the implementation more difficult.
