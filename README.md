# Data Structure Implementations

This repository contains C++ implementations of two common data structures: vectors and linked lists.

# Vector
A vector is a dynamic array that can resize itself as needed to accommodate new elements. 
It supports efficient random access and constant time insertion and deletion at the end of the vector.

# Linked List
A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing a reference to the next node in the list. 
It supports constant time insertion and deletion at the beginning and end of the list, as well as efficient traversal of the list.
